# My-Solutions-deeplearning.ai-Coursera

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. The codes for the assignments are pushed in this repo. Most of the code is pre-written, my code goes in the space below "START CODE HERE".

Currently, this repo has 3 major parts you may be interested in and I will give a list here.

## Programming Assignments

### Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

* Logistic Resgression with a Neural Network mindset
* PLanar data classification with one hidden layer
* Building your Deep Neural Network
* Deep Neaural Network for Image Classification: Application

### Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

* Initialization
* Regularization
* Gradient Checking
* Optimization Methods
* Tensorflow Tutorial

### Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects

* There is no PA for this course. But this course comes with very interesting case study quizzes.
  
### Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks

* Convolutional Model: step-by-step
* Convolutional Model: Application
* Keras Tutorial - Happy House
* Residual Networks

### Course 5: Sequence Models

* Building a Recurrent Neural Network - Step-by-Step
* Character level language model - Dinosaurun land

## Quizzes

I have completed all the quizes in every course in this specialization.
